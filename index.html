        <h3 class="lb_heading">ShellieMay</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          ShellieMay is a teddy bear Minnie Mouse made for Duffy. More
          adventurous than he, ShellieMay encourages Duffy to take one step
          further than he normally would. In that sense, ShellieMay plays an
          important role in expanding Duffy's horizons. Being crafty and
          ingenious, she enjoys creating charming gifts for her friends—whether
          it's making a scrunchy for StellaLou's new dance routine or
          improvising musical instruments for 'Olu Mel. ShellieMay hopes that
          her small gestures will brighten their day, especially when they are
          in need of support and friendship.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Duffy</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Imagineers first created Duffy's story within the context of American
          Waterfront at Tokyo DisneySea. Almost everything done at Imagineering
          starts with story. This particular story goes…when Mickey Mouse the
          sailor, based in Cape Cod, was leaving on a long sea voyage, Minnie
          Mouse made Duffy to keep Mickey company during his travels. Minnie
          presented her hand-sewn bear to Mickey in a duffel bag, which is how
          Mickey came up with the name Duffy. But stories can evolve, and as
          Duffy's story has evolved, he and Mickey have visited many exciting
          places together, meeting new friends along the way. With a willingness
          to do anything to bring a smile to his friends, and his quintessential
          innocence, Duffy takes all of us back to our childhood when we all had
          an inner Duffy.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">StellaLou</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          StellaLou is a lavender rabbit whose dream is to become a Broadway
          dancer. She loves dancing more than anything. Whenever she hears music
          playing or birds singing, she feels like dancing to the sound. The
          path to performing on the Broadway stage is not an easy one, but she
          is determined and dedicated. If she makes a mistake, she keeps trying
          until she gets it right—she does not give up easily. All her friends
          cheer her on, and they are inspired and encouraged by the hard work
          she puts in to reach her goal.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">CookieAnn</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          CookieAnn, a yellow dog with a sensitive nose and long floppy ears, is
          a passionate and optimistic friend who loves to invent something novel
          by combining things. With a chef's hat on her head, she is an 'expert'
          in inventing unique recipes, bringing surprise and joy to her friends
          in unexpectedly delicious ways. Curious about everything, CookieAnn's
          inventions go beyond culinary creations. She has fun conjuring up
          out-of-the-box solutions to problems by combining different ideas.
          Additionally, with her acute olfactory ability, she is able to smell
          'unsavory' happenings!

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Olu Mel</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Olu Mel is a turtle slightly shy and reserved but is truly passionate
          about and talented in music. Surrounded by the beautiful nature of
          Hawai'i, he learned how to hear and appreciate the music played by
          nature—birds, trees, winds and ocean waves. He also uses his ukulele
          to write songs about nature, adventure, and friendship, which have the
          power to bring courage and smiles to his friends, and to himself!
          Whenever Olu Mel plays music, Duffy and his friends feel happy and
          closer to each other.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Gelatoni</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Gelatoni is an artistic cat with a sunny personality. Being
          resourceful, he can use his tail as a paint brush or create a piece of
          art with whatever is available (even gelato Duffy accidentally dropped
          on the ground!). Besides being passionate about art, Gelatoni is able
          to see beauty in everything. He finds inspiration everywhere, from
          flowers smiling at the sun to park benches saving a space for someone
          special to sit. Being an artist, he is a bit unpredictable at times,
          but his friends find that part of him amusing.
